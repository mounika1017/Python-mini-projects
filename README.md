# Pascal's Triangle using Python (Lists)

This program prints Pascal's Triangle for a given number of rows using Python.
The implementation uses lists to store each row and generates the next row by
adding adjacent elements of the previous row.

## Concept Used
- Lists
- Nested loops
- Pattern printing
- Basic arithmetic operations

## How the Program Works
1. The first row is initialized as [1].
2. Each new row starts and ends with 1.
3. Middle elements are formed by adding adjacent elements of the previous row.
4. The process repeats until the required number of rows is printed.
